# lets-grow

## Description

- Let’s Grow is about helping people, like you, grow their knowledge by providing materials and trainers for whatever kind of help you may need! We allow you to control how much or how little guidance you will need to grow; whether that be a few guides, tips, or a 1 on 1 with a trainer - it is all up to you! So let’s grow together!

## The Goal

- AS AN avid learner
  I WANT to use resources that help me learn
  SO THAT I can grow my knowledge at my pace
